There is one jupyter notebook, which consists of the deep learning model.

In order to run this jupyter notebook there are certain requirements you need to download such as tensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn and few others.
You can download these libraries by using the command: pip install <library name>.

The input for this deep learning model will be an image, preferably in jpg format. 
The output of this deep learning model will be the classification of the image into one of the three classes and those three classes are premium(Fresh), good(Half-fresh) and poor(spoiled)

The accuracy of this model is approximately 92%.
